# Process

---

### Initial

-  Started with importing necessary assets and building the login form
-  Made various states to replicate the behavior of the interaction
   -  Error message and UI
   -  Focus interaction - on floating label animation
   -  Password toggle view
-  Added personal touch on maintaining the aspect ratio of the hero art upon responsive rescaling
-  Refactor process with Sim Ho and Steve using Live-share for feedback
-  Selected MySQL as the choice of DBMS instead of MongoDB following these info from IBM
   -  **MySQL is well-suited for the following use cases:**
      -  High-traffic sites, such as e-commerce or social sites
      -  Sites that require high security protocols, such as government-based and compliance-heavy industries
   -  **MongoDB is optimal for the following use cases:**
      -  Legacy businesses that seek to upgrade big data
      -  Content management systems (CMS)
      -  High-query sites and applications, such as analytics apps

### Problems

-  Faced difficulties on constructing input handler + animation - tried to use components to simplify the code blocks but the life cycle was confusing
   -  callback functions not put to use in the end
-  Using onChange the inputs are recognized 1 input later than wanted, hence brought useEffect to play
-  Overuse of useState and useEffect due to difficulties with child-parent communication
   -  Caused confusions when trying to manage crowded changes on interaction
   -  Error was checked on parent but the cycle was immutable? on child upon passing
-  Had bug after pressing button and using keyboard input causing a random border appearing on it â†’ :focus-visible had inherent outline
   -  Introduced focus state
-  Faced troubles with deployment, but fixed with creating netlify.toml file locally
   -  Had to include not only redirect but build command here too
-  Issues with non secured http font linkâ€¦ solved by using import/link to @fontface
   -  Lazy web font loading causes some render delays
-  setSelectionRange was not working by function of onClick â†’ useEffect resolved it without using it for cursor focus
-  passing object props and recognizing change of state was an issue due to the way react reads it
-  React-select library - blur on selection
-  To improve performance, minify was considered but realized that jsx format doesnâ€™t auto minify on React unlike js
-  Had this funny error with CSS on modal, turns out it was due to a misinputted ; in between the classes that stopped it from reading the styles underneath

### Lessons

-  Introduction to component based coding with React
   -  Refactored after achieving the result interaction
-  Utilized React Hooks and knowledge of React components for more manageable code
-  Used React Portal for modal to maintain event delegation provided but render above all
-  react transition group animation library â†’ had trouble using translate 50% centered for uprising animation
-  Utilize Lighthouse to check and optimize performance
-  Setting up a light-weight backend with Node.js + MySQL
   -  Learnt deploying with Heroku
   -  Dealing with requests, response
   -  Insomnia to check for backend functions
-  On deployment, iOS device had input value not filling bug
   -  Turns out it was stylesheet reset and was re-deployed
